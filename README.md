# Tuple Out Dice Game

This is a Python version of "Tuple Out" dice game.

## How to Play

1. Run the script and enter the number of players when prompted.
2. Each player takes a turn rolling three dice.
   - If all three dice show the same value (a tuple), the player scores 0 for that turn.
   - If two dice show the same value (doubles), those two dice are "fixed," and the player re-rolls the remaining die. The final score is the sum of the fixed dice and the last roll.
   - If no doubles or tuples, the score for the turn is the sum of all three dice.
3. Play continues until one player reaches the target score of 50 or the maximum number of turns (5) is reached.
4. The player with the highest score at the end wins.
